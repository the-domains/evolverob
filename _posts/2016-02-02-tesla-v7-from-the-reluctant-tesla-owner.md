Why would anyone take to the Atlanta interstates at 7:30 in the 
morning if you didn't have to get some place? Why would a work for home 
guy go out cruising at that time of the day? Well as you may have heard 
Tesla made v7 of their software available and I had to try it out for 
myself!

I'm not an early Tesla adopter, I'm a reluctant (at first) owner. Due
to unfortunate circumstances my wife and I found ourselves in the 
market for a new car. She commutes across Atlanta every day and with the
maintenance, fuel cost and HOT (High Occupancy Toll) lane costs we 
found the Tesla case could make sense for us. Since we got the car at 
the end of June this year we have put on 9,400 miles. Those miles 
include road trips and daily commutes.

First things first: Read the Release Notes. With a redesign I wanted 
to make sure I knew how to do everything before hitting the streets. 
There has been a lot of talk around auto pilot for good reason but Tesla
also added some additional features that aren't reported as widely. 
They really did a good of job of updating the interface and making a few
things easier to find.  

I'm going to give some of my favorites of v7 and my initial auto pilot observations.

### Best Usability Features:

1. Instrument cluster gives a clear indication of what is going around 
you according to the car. What the sensors are "seeing" is more 
transparent.
2. Door lock / unlock on the flat panel status bar (finally a one step process).

To really give Auto Pilot a work out, I drove the Tesla from Suwanee,
GA south to North Druid Hills Road in Atlanta during rush hour (heavy 
traffic for non-Atlanta people). I then turned around and went back in 
speed limit conditions (light to medium traffic) to Suwanee. I then 
drove to the Suwanee Town Center to try out the parallel parking. As a 
note Tesla encourages you to keep your hands on the wheel and publishes 
in the release notes that Auto Pilot is a Beta.

### Auto Pilot Observations:

1. Auto pilot works fantastic but it does best when lane markings are 
clear. If the readings aren't clear it will notify you to take control.
2. Auto pilot doesn't work that well when you're merging from the on ramp into traffic.
3. You can engage auto pilot when driving really slow on the interstate
in rush hour and it works fantastic. If you've been using the cruise 
for your commute moving to the steering is seamless.
4. Using auto pilot doesn't seem to let you change lanes to move into 
HOV/HOT lanes, but doesn't have a problem letting you change out of 
them.
5. I used auto pilot for lane changing in slow and fast conditions and 
it was very smooth. If you turned the turn signal off half way through 
the change it will return to your lane.
6. I couldn't get auto park to parallel park (or even to find a space) 
despite ensuring that I found a space bordered by two cars and curb (as 
described in the release notes). Maybe the space was too large? 
Regardless I'll be trying this again and will let you know.

I wanted to get my observations and impressions out there to share. 
If you have any questions or comments please reach out and I will be 
glad to help out in any way I can. Oh, one last note for those that 
would counter, "what's the big deal, other Tesla's not the first to have
these features". I'll tell you what my fourth grader said, "Dad you got
new features without having to get a new car, just like upgrading your 
phone."
